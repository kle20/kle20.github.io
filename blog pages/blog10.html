                For a class, I've been working on a project requested by a rather large company I'll leave unnamed.
                And earlier today, I was introduced to a company's official design system -- an official, real design system!
                It's hard to envision how topics students learn in class are actually practiced in the industry.
                (Which is why experience holds more weight than education after a certain point in peoples' college careers.)
                For example, I was listening to Figma's video series on design systems but without some concrete example to attach it to, it was just a nebulous idea I just happen to rotely memorize.
                Not that it was as boring as memorizing state capitols, I'd actually still recommend it.
                (So watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK-pHkc5EL4&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx6ZQswH9nVKVMCsK83OzhoV)
                But tangent aside, I make the best connections when I learn by doing.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                What I ended up learning was that design systems are like LEGOs when it comes to a cohesive product.
                At first glance, it's perfect for creating something that looks nice and fits together well!
                After some thought, you notice if there's only a single 'set' of LEGOs, there's really only one way to create something nice out of them.
                But an experienced... LEGO-crafter(?), person who makes LEGO art, will be able to create masterpieces with only a few extra pieces and a lot of skill.
                Constraints are an enemy or friend depending on the skill level of the designer.
                But in the long run, at the end of the journey, constraints like in a design system are more for cohesion than mere simplicity.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                This analogy will help me remember in the future that design systems aren't meant to be discouraging my creativity.
                They'll actually exercise my creativity by providing a challenge!
                Additionally, like LEGOs, the fewest different kinds doesn't make for an interesting final product.
                So I shouldn't be hesitant about adding new components when nesessary.
