            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Earlier today, I participated in a workshop about accessibility -- which, as a teaser, I'll refer as the UIUN Summit.
                I wanted to write a blog post about it while it was still fresh in my mind because it served its purpose well.
                A bunch of young designers (including me) were forced to think about a different facet of UI accessibility that we hadn't really worked with before.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                The background is that everyone in the workshop was in a team about to completely overhaul a website (which was arbitrarily a random county's voting site).
                Each person chose a population to represent and advocate accessibility features for; for example, I represented the blind population.
                To clarify, I don't mean total blindness, or also known as absolutely no vision at all.
                Most blind people still have some kind of sight -- usually a little light vision.
                So while my main focus was on screen reader accessibility (which many blind folk use to navigate the Internet rather than a computer screen), I still kept in mind some sight-reliant accessibility issues.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I had a handful of requirements I would be completely non-negotiable about including, mostly related to screen readers.
                But honestly, my game plan going into the actual negotiations wasn't complete victory.
                It was a battle to balance my (pretend-serious) duty to my blind constituents with my bigger-picture sense that other populations also had different needs.
                Afterall, it'd be against the point of the Internet, where all kinds of people connect with each other, if the accessibility needs of only a single population were being accomodated.
                My strategy for representing my population was to appeal to the common accomodations that a majority of other populations would agree with.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I brought to the table simple, straight-to-the-point wording and high contrast text as some of my suggestions.
                Because I knew many other populations like non-native speakers or those with intellectual disabilities for the former suggestion would prioritize them.
                However, for the latter, I went in assuming representatives who wanted low contrast text would be hard to bring on board such as the dyslexia and photosensitivity population.
                But with some smart rewording, a feature that let's users change the contrast level satisfied all parties with thoughts on contrast.
                It kind of sounds like an omnibus bill, but honestly a little creative thinking can often lead to an emcompassing solution that only requires a tad bit more effort.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                And now, onto those non-negotiable requirements I mentioned earlier... 
                It might be surprising to hear that a built-in screen reader wasn't anywhere near my top priority.
                Despite other populations advocating for one, my reasoning was that my population would have their own screen readers anyway.
                It would've been putting in effort that could be better spent elsewhere.
                I thought it was more important to have features that didn't exist before, in this case, alt-text on all non-decorative images.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I would've thought this was the requirement I'd need to pay attention to the most.
                Since I assumed I wouldn't have allies that also explicitly benefited from it.
                Additionally, I was battling the colorblind representatives about prioritizing colorblind friendly colors in images versus having alt-text for images.
                (They were honestly my most difficult group to convince because we both had challenges with vision -- but in very different ways.)
                But through constructive argument and other representatives chipping in, I realized the wide range of people a seemingly specialized accomodation helped.
                For example, users with slow internet (say, if they lived in rural areas) would have faster loading times using alt-text rather than images.
                Furthermore, colorblind users could also use alt-text if they couldn't see the image correctly while screen readers wouldn't benefit from an image with more accessible colors.
                For these reasons, I was staunch on alt-text in a way I wouldn't have ever been without a bit of healthy conflict to really see the importance of it.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                In the theoretical world you learn about in class, everything is ideal -- and in an ideal world, everyone can be accomodated.
                In the real world, factoring in time and effort means that not everything can be implemented.
                So this workshop revolved around balancing what should be done with what can.
                It involved a lot of patience and empathy to make sure everyone could be satisfied that they did their part to include another population's needs.
                And additionally, everyone came out of it more aware of the practical, specific requirements for accessibility of a variety of populations!
                I would recommend this kind of workshop to any designer that wants to be worth their salt.
