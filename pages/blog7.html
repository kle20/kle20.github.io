                It's leadership classes nowadays where you do all the self-reflection and soul searching.
                Usually it's with the context of knowing how you can best be a leader.
                For example, Colin Breck has a great post on his blog about choosing two tenets to live and act by.
                (Linked here: https://blog.colinbreck.com/understanding-our-core-values-an-exercise-for-individuals-and-teams/)
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Personally, one of the values I chose was competence; I want to be trusted as a person who can do their work.
                In spite of the original purpose of the exercise, I think applying my core values in other areas will strengthen my work there.
                Let's look at design -- which is fundamentally an agreement between user and designer.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                The word of the day will be trust. 
                The user must trust that the designer knows what they're doing, else the user would just leave.
                In action, this appears in choices like navigation features the designer gives the user -- either in amount or quality.
                Those are the wise words of Steve Krug in his book Don't Make Me Think that I want to take to heart.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                It's the reason why I sharpen my design skills instead of creating whatever comes first to my mind.
                (Trust me, the least irritating design decision I'd do would've been an eye-searing color scheme. The /least/ irritating thing.)
                To have a purpose is to make sure your destination will be reached.
                Mine will be achieving the ability to establish trust with my final products -- through compotence.
