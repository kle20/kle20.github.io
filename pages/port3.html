                I think if you want to see evidence of evolution, you should check the portfolio entry for "A Fueler's Map".
                It's an entry that wasn't prompted by the UX/UI class, but rather for Design Studio.
                I used a lot of tips and tricks I learned throughout this semester in that DS project -- particularly about stories and user feedback.
                Anyway, my portfolio isn't very relevant to my likely future career, so I chose some values that reflected that. 
                I decided that my two values for my portfolio would be approachable and respect.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For being approachable, I decided to relax any serious, professional undertones.
                    My writing is fairly casual and more of a narrative of my thoughts on the matter.
                    I've also paid particular attention to white space within text, trying to avoid intimidating large blocks of text.
                    And the longer posts -- portfolio entries and a study or two -- are also segmented by headers to make them more digestable.
                    Additionally, I don't follow a particular color scheme besides purple for navigational items.
                    That colorfulness for all my images helps the friendly, approachable value I want my portfolio to have.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For respect, I wanted to make sure that anyone who wanted to visit my portfolio was "treated well" so to say.
                    (So I'm like being a good host!)
                    This plays into having a quality interface; so anything clickable has some sort of signifier and all images have alt text.
                    I'd say the organization of my portfolio shouldn't cause any frustrations either.
                    Things are either divided into a portfolio entry or a blog post -- which I think is easy to understand and navigate.
                    From a different end of respect, any material I've referenced is explicitly cited within my writing -- making sure they're credited properly (even if it's in a more casual way).
