                When I was in high school, I was a competing member in our Speech team.
                As a quick recap of Speech tournaments, students would perform their script for a judge to rank each round and recieve the judges' critiques after the tournament.
                Counterintuitively, I almost never read my critiques.
                Not because I knew I did terribly or that I thought I was too good for criticism, but because it felt like opening Pandora's box every time.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                That's a great segway into the main topic of today!
                The word of the day is not actually feedback -- but the topic of this post is certainly about feedback.
                Actually, we're going to analyze recieving feedback through the lens of attachment.
                I was inspired (and remembered my own embarassing experiences with recieving feedback) after reading an article by Jes Kirkwook linked here: https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/give-designers-feedback/
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                In my case, I poured my heart and soul into those scripts and performances; I didn't have the heart to hear anything negative about it.
                (Of course, there was probably a good dose of adolescent self-confidence issues... 
                But being confident in your skills has never been a struggle exclusive to teenagers.
                Everyone has to be mediocre before they master a skill.)
                But back to the point, one of the tips Kirkwood shares in the article is to "learn to let it go".
                People become too attached to their work and conflate anything said about the product to the designer.
                Of course, any well-intentioned critiquer gives feedback only to help the designer improve.
                However, emotions are not logical -- so it's important to get a reign on them before they're tested when you get feedback.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Sometimes attachment only appears in very specific aspects of a design instead of the entire thing.
                There may a menu or photo grid layout a designer put blood, sweat, and tears on it -- and they won't hear a thing against it because of their attachment.
                A mindset like that is a slippery slope into stonewalling change.
                And change, of course, is how to improve both the final product and the designer's skills.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Onto a tangential point raised in Kirkwood's article, I find it so fascinating that the old popular advice of bookending negative feedback with two positives has been coined outdated.
                Not that I'm surprised.
                In my Speech tournament days, the ribbons I recieved were not often for first place.
                Honestly, after so many of them for the variety of places I earned, they felt empty in meaning.
                Especially since they were stapled on top of my critique papers -- just like the frosting on top of a broccoli brownie.
                Trying to deliver feedback that way is very much like that: basically a consolation prize.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I'm older now, and don't participate in Speech tournaments anymore (except as an alum judge).
                But that doesn't mean more critique isn't going to head my way, like during a performance review at work or just as I live life in general.
                Even more so as I continue on trying to improve my design skills.
                Trying to regulate my attachment to my works in progress will allow me (and anyone else that takes this advice) to accept feedback with grace and much more effectiveness.
