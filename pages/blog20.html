                I'm glad that more people are told that accessibility helps everyone nowadays.
                It's not just about the specially-made devices like the Project Leonardo gaming controller -- which is what's in the featured image of this blog.
                While I as someone with functioning vision can read low-contrast text, it's not like I wouldn't vastly prefer to be reading black on white rather than gray on gray.
                But sometimes I'm concerned that people don't actually understand that enough.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I was reading Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug, and his chapter 12 is all about accessibility.
                What caught me off guard was his claim that the common person couldn't (or maybe worsely, wouldn't) think of many ways accessibility changes were benefitial to more than just the target audience.
                Notable examples like closed captioning come to mind as positive evidence... 
                But I think -- like bringing attention to the wider benefits of accessiblity -- we just need more exposure to more examples.
                So that's what this blog post will revolve around: experiences where I, a person with no disabilities, have benefited from accessibility features.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                This first example comes from another tip from Krug's aforementioned book: "make all content accessible by keyboard".
                Because sometimes, it's not the user who isn't able to use a mouse, but the mouse itself that doesn't work.
                Windows the operating system is sometimes (lovingly(?)) known to have a few bugs and things go wrong.
                Multiple occasions, I've had my cursor not move despite the perfectly functional mouse and user, so I've had to resort to abusing the Tab and Enter keys of my keyboard to navigate.
                Without the forethought of designers to add this functionality, I'd be stuck in the ocean of the world-wide web without a paddle.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                In a different example, I actually preferred using the mouse over keyboard controls.
                I've recently bought the Ace Attorney Trilogy (a visual novel style of video game) for PC because I wanted to see the upgraded graphics compared to the original DS version.
                I was too used to relying on the stylus in the DS version and didn't want to detract time from enjoying the game with learning the keyboard button equivalents.
                So when I clung to using my mouse and cursor to play the game, I was pleasantly surprised that actions like opening the inventory could still be done with a tap (of the mouse rather than the stylus).
                While I definitely could have eventually learned the new keyboard controls, my main goal was to enjoy the visual novel -- not learn new arbritary keybinds.
                Accessibility just allowed me to skip a tedious step. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                It's a blessing that designers have included accessibility in their focus when creating designs.
                Like any carefully-crafted plan, you don't always anticipate what the user will actually do or their current circumstances.
                So that's why accessibility functionality, giving users multiple ways to achieve their goal within the design, is so important.
                Because when one avenue falls short -- whether due to disability or more temporary setbacks -- users will keep being able to move on and progress.
