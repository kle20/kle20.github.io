                While I was reading Steve Krug's Don't Make Me Think, I was suddenly reminded of a silent complaint I had about an interface earlier today.
                I'm currently in the user testing section of the book, so it's been in the forefront of my mind that even I could be a casual tester.
                So I was "testing" a website I'll be using often now and in the future.
                Very, very unofficially, I would say there's one aspect of the interface that needs some work: wording.

                For some background information, I'm studying to become an actuary -- and many actuaries gain creditation through the SOA (Society of Actuaries).
                I was on soa.org and my task was pretty straightforward: register for VEE credit.
                Honestly, framing my quest as a user test experience instead of being slightly lost made the process less frustrating.
                I'm still very new to the world of actuaries, so specific terminology and groupings can still puzzle me.
                
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                In this way, I couldn't find which button to click without struggle -- because I was looking for "VEE" or "credit".
                Eventually I did find "VEE" under "Education and Exams"... which does make sense in hindsight.
                This could effectively be summarized as SOA's keywords not being the same as mine.
            </p>

                Steve Krug had mentioned this in his user testing section, which is how this entire tangent came up.
                It'll be important to remember that my wording for a design really matters because people tend to skim for key words instead of actually comprehending.
                I had done that just earlier today!
                So this is something I know I'll remember and apply to my future designs because of my firsthand experience with it.
                After all, what's the point of learning how to design if not to fix the design mistakes I come across?
