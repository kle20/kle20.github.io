                I'd call these blogs the desert of this site.
                They're nice digestable tidbits that showcase very specialized aspects of my designing experience.
                They say you know a topic well if you can explain the concept in your own way -- which is really the reason these blogs exist.
                However, the main course here will always be the portfolio of my own work.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I'm always open to ways to improve my portfolio, so I decided to read some tips and tricks other people have to say.
                Today, I want to focus on "24 Impressive UX Portfolio Examples and a Guide for Creating Yours" by Klaudia Simon and Ákos Izsák on uxfolio (https://blog.uxfol.io/ux-portfolio-examples/).
                To summarize and emphasize a key point I gathered from nearly all 24 examples: consistency is key.
                To be exact, consistency in both visual elements and color scheme really boosts a portfolio.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                By definition, you usually want to showcase a wide range of examples in your portfolio -- to show that you can create a wide range of final products.
                Each portfolio entry will be unique and look different from the others, but how do you still make a collection of them cohesive?
                The answer provided in the article linked is having consistent "containers" for each entry.
                If, for example, all the thumbnail images are all formatted the same -- maybe with a unique portfolio-specifc pattern or style -- then that will act as the ribbon to tie it all together.
                Another method for consistency is the color choice of a portfolio.
                I really enjoyed the example where all the colors where desaturated and "dusty".
                It showcased that consistency doesn't just mean limiting color choice; as long as a certain aspect of all the colors are consistent, then all the different color schemes of each portfolio entry can still be cohesive.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Consistency also shows up in other areas, such as font or just sharp vs. round shapes.
                Overall, while design is about stretching our creative skills, it's the constraints that help keep that creativity stick to a single purpose: function paired with aesthetics.
                That's why consistency is so important, it corrals that creativity into a single product users can enjoy.
