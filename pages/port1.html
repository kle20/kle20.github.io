        <section>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I talk a lot about how to design here, so it's about time to put all of those specifics into action.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                At the time of writing this, I'm a student still learning the ins and outs of designing.
                There's probably more passion than skill in anything I design at this point, but I've gotta start somewhere!
                And of course, there's no better way to improve through experience by making mistakes.
                (Fail fast and early as some might say.)
                So I partnered with a fellow classmate, Natalia, over the course of a semester to bring an interface to life.
            </p>
            <h2 class="blog-header">Project Declaration & User Stories</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Natalia approached with the idea, but it was a solution to a problem we both could relate to.
                We're roommates actually, and our dorm notably has skeins of yarn laying around everywhere.
                Though Natalia has a better track record with completed projects than me, we both work with yarn as a hobby.
                Sometimes while working on a project, the stitch patterns were complex and hard to remember, or so mindnumbingly simple that it was easy to lose count.
                We wanted a way to keep track of our progress on yarn projects -- knitting for me and crocheting for her.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                So in a nutshell, our application would store information for a knitting/crochet project -- such as a blanket or doily.
                (A Github for yarn as someone giving us feedback once told us.)
                Most importantly, users would be able to reference the stitches (steps) of a project from this application.
                As the user works on the project, they'd be able to mark their progress and see what stitching pattern they'd need to do for the next number of rows. 
                It'd prevent them from losing their place and making mistakes from that.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Not so coincidentially, our user stories were very reminiscent of ourselves because this was a solution that catered towards people like us.
                We imagined our user as a college student, only able to work on their projects in short bursts.
                Therefore, they couldn't always remember where exactly they left off in the pattern if they hadn't picked up the project in a while.
                Additionally, they could be distracted while working because they're multitasking (by hopefully watching a movie and not in the middle of a lecture).
                Having a design do the remembering for them would allow them to enjoy knitting/crocheting more by making it an easier activity to complete.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                And so came to birth "Stitch-onary" (name still pending), an interface we'd design to fill this niche.
                The main purpose would be to house all information a user would want about their various yarn projects in one tidy place.
                This includes resources like the project's full pattern, reference images and the stitch-tracking progress recorder.
                (However, it'll be important to note that the newly-dubbed Stitch Tracker feature would be the only thing prototyped to functionality.)
            </p>
            <h2 class="blog-header">Interface Sketches and Values</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                We decided to design for two platforms, mobile and desktop, for reasons that'll be touched upon later.
                I was mainly in charge of the desktop version, and with the extra space afforded from a larger screen, I thought mimicking binders in their organization would be interesting.
                This mainly translated to being able to navigate between projects easily using actually tab-shaped navigation tabs.
                Here's the initial sketch to show the workflow inside a project and a list of navigation capabilities:
            </p>
            <img class="blog-image" src="../images/port1.1.png" alt="Sketch of Interface">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use the horizontal menu above (tabs) to switch between projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scroll with the sidebar OR use the collapsable left navigation menu to move between sections of the project. 
                    (Ex. The top intro, stitch counter, pattern blueprints, an extra section for directions for a harder stitchâ€¦)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hit the user icon in the top right to do important functions with profiles like logging out or editing settings.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                And here's what the sketch looks like translated into Figma:
            </p>
            <iframe style="border: 1px solid hsl(266, 35%, 35%);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FhBsHqny17HwiM6dzy4S3is%2FMockups%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3DDFkH3A691lkocMmT-1" allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Our main values to capture going in were creativity and accessibility.
                This manifested in many ways in our design system.
                For example, while mobile would always be the most... mobile option and allow a user to work from anywhere, not everyone works like that.
                So that explains why we split into designing a mobile version (Natalia) and a desktop version (Kyana).
                And while this should've logically included a tablet version, the two of us didn't have the capacity for a third version of the same interface.
                For creativity, our design system had a wide variety of hues defined to switch the color pallette of the interface.
                A color wheel might've been the more unrestricted option, but we just wanted the interface to support the aesthetic of the project.
                And so, a restricted (but still plentiful) set of color options accomplished not eclipsing the projects themselves while still being carefully formatted to have high contrast for usability.
                For a last example, there's a slight paper texture (that you actually can't notice until the final version) to the background to give the feeling of a physical notebook/binder of organized projects.
            </p>
            <h2 class="blog-header">Iteration and Iteration and Iteration</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                That was a lot of talk, so let me just show what our first working prototype looked like:
            </p>
            <iframe style="border: 1px solid hsl(266, 35%, 35%);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FTXVQGBUadZxdOjT1WI6VFy%2FPrototypes%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3DhS9V2dFkMKS5RvpK-1" allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                It's fairly rudimentary; the interface is already opened to a generic project and it's progress tracker.
                But it showcases how progress could be tracked well (increasing/decreasing the number of stitches you've marked as completed) and how other information would be displayed (like the upcoming stitches or overall stats).
                However, the interface then went through two rounds of user testing: one with colleagues and one with actual potential users.
                Through the first round, we realized that while it was fairly easy to learn after awhile, our interface wasn't friendly towards beginners or those new to the "lingo" of stitches.
                So we set out to reword our section that listed the upcoming stitches in addition to some resizing of text for easier understanding.
                The scope of the prototype was also eventually expanded, just so navigation was possible and more than one generic project was accessible.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                The second round of testers had some experience following a pattern in knitting/crocheting, so this pass was to test how intuitive our interface was to navigate and use.
                Most of our testers were fairly tech-savvy since they college-student age, so we acknowledged this hole in our user coverage but weren't too worried about it.
                We reasoned that if a user wasn't comfortable with technology, they'd seek a non-technological solution instead anyway.
                The following is a list of the issues we noticed through testing and implementation of fixes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Both mobile and desktop version will be checked over and compared for discrepancies in component use and specific wording. 
                    While the general feel of both versions match, users' first impression of the professionalism of the interface is lessened if there are inconsistencies for something that should be the same, just translated to a different platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A feature to increment by rows instead of just by stitch will be added. 
                    Through user testing, we've realized that by stitch is just too slow and repetitive after awhile. 
                    Reducing the amount of clicks needed to use our interface will let users focus on what should be focused on, their knitting/crocheting project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes, users will make massive amounts of progress away from our interface, but would still want to reflect their progress for later use. 
                    Similar to above, if the only way to progress in the stitch tracker is by stitch, users will be reluctant to pick up our interface again because of the large amount of works (clicks) needed to bring the stitch tracker up to date. 
                    So we will add a manual progress override feature so any size of progress can be quickly recorded.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The next stitches section in the mobile version will include more detail. 
                    Users through user testing tended to get confused by reading the pattern there as there was no indication of where a row began/ended.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                So finally, here's how the prototype ended up looking like after adapting to user critiques. 
                For the sake of this project, this is how Natalia and I are going to leave it for developmental milestone reasons.
                Honestly, I'm proud of how far I've come -- with, of course, help from my partner/roommate in crime!
