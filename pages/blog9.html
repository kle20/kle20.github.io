                There's a lot of tutorials out there about the basics of web design.
                Composition, how colors work together, what the actual purpose of headers are, etc... 
                But the next step -- combining all that you've learned into something tangible -- is less talked about.
                (Especially how to do effectively!)
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Thankfully, the Internet really has everything; it just takes a little digging.
                Figma, for example, has a very informative set of readings about design systems -- how designers untangle all aspects of design into something more organized.
                I'll touch upon a bit of multiple of them, but here's the one that'll be the main focus of this post: https://www.designsystems.com/typography-guides/
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Today's word will build more on a previously mentioned word journal.
                We'll explore how consistency also builds trust in a designer and keeps users on the site instead of leaving out of frustration.
                In a way, the navigation options (the previous blog's topic) should always be consistent to be a homebase users can always rely on.
                But there's so much more to consistency than that.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                The post linked earlier covers consistency in typography (aka the words you're currently reading right now and many others).
                Even the subtlest differences in font can be noticed and present slightly different moods that a design can envoke.
                So it's therefore essential that designs don't have too many fonts, else the personality of a design gets muddled.
                And, of course, first impressions matter much more when people don't pay too much attention to get to know the object of attention.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Additionally, the fancy fonts always take a moment for the user to get used to, as they're often difficult to read.
                Using too many of them turns a design into letter soup. Visually, it's hard to digest.
                What also creates letter soup is too many alterations to the text from bold letters or underlines to multiple sizes of the same font. 
                It'll just start looking like those messages created from cutout magazine letters!
                So in the end, consistency is key.
                And in typography it's not only font styles, but font sizes and even the most minute of details like spacing or even use of italics.
