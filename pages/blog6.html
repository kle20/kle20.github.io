                The book The Complete Color Harmony: Pantone Edition by Leatrice Eiseman is a great display book with how vibrant its printing is.
                It covers some foundational basics of color -- one of which I'd like to cover more in detail today here.
                Before showing all the neat color swatches, the book gives tips on how readers can create their own color pallettes.
                While it merely says that you can (and should) have a variety of colors in a pallette, I can explain a bit further than that.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Pleasing pallettes happen in color picking as a delicious meal happens in cooking.
                You'll have a main taste to the meal, like a savory steak or sweet pudding.
                But the experienced chefs know that introducing complexity into the dish is what raises their cooking to the next level.
                Like maybe a salty sauce to the steak or bitter dark chocolate shavings as a dessert topping, it'll bring out the dominant flavor.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                The same thing applies to color design: you'll have a primary color with secondary colors to support it.
                Giving all colors the same weight will wash them all out and confuse the messages each color sends.
                So it's important to balance them accordingly; in the illustration world, we usually call it the 60-30-10 rule.
                The main color is 60% of the composition, the supporting 30%, and accents only 10%.
                The small allocation of the accents give them value in scarcity, while not outdoing the main vibes the image should give.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Color is one of the first aspects of a design people notice, so it's imperative to have a refined color scheme.
                First impressions matter when users of a design aren't encouraged to think too deeply about the design choices --
                so the subconcious emotions a design should signal can't afford to be muddled with an unbalanced color pallette.
