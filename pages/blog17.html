                I won't be the last to admit that I'll never be a master of any design application -- whether that be a drawing app or PowerPoint.
                But Figma especially, there's always something I don't know about it.
                I'll take any tips or tricks offered to me about Figma.
                So as I was watching "Designing And Prototyping With Figma" on the CareerFoundry Youtube Channel, I had an epiphany.
                The design expert who led it, Olga Voskoboinikova, was incredibly knowlegable about Figma.
                The video honestly didn't cover many design principles, but how to work the application itself.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Because that's always half of the battle; you can't create a master painting if you don't even know how to wield a brush.
                And she made elements like creating unique shapes look so easy.
                It took her seconds to create a bending arrow where that would've taken me multiple minutes -- mainly because I would've had to fumble around first before successfully creating one.
                That made me think about driving, and how more often than not, a local can forego any GoogleMaps route if they've lived in a place long enough.
                Creating an interface in Figma is like driving a new route.
                An experienced local can just recognize landmarks or optimal streets they've taken in the past to whip up a path to their destination without outside help.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Just by knowing how to use an application (Figma), I'd already be saving so much time in the creation process.
                Because I wouldn't need to search for a guide on how to do a specific task, I could just reference my past experiences on what I know Figma can offer.
                That's the power of an expert in their field; their experience is worth more than anything.
                And that's what I strive to be, maybe not a master in design and Figma, but at the very least an expert.
