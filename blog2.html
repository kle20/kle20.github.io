                Did you see a duck or a rabbit in the image above?
                Personally, I saw the duck first. But you may have seen the rabbit.
                It just goes to show that people can see different things in the same image.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Along those lines, I'm going to summarize many concepts in design thinking with the word perspective. 
                In his book The Design of Everything, Don Norman explains the numerous impacts of perspective on design.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Emotion, which design heavily relies upon, is entirely based on the user's perspective. 
                The emotions a design invokes are unique for each user. 
                Additionally, the "state" of each user (i.e. how distracted or stressed they are) is always changing. 
                It depends on their perspective -- what events led up to them using the design -- so they may be more or less prone to make a mistake each time they use it.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Lastly, this can all culminate into a unique experience in using a design. 
                The conceptual model formed can wildly differ in effectiveness based on this -- and forever make a lasting impression on how a person uses/feels about a design. 
                Designers capture the most users by keeping this fluidity in mind, accommodating the widest range of perspectives they can.
